# Quick Start
- Download and extract the .zip folder from releases.
- Double click the r6 afk.exe to run it.
- Press F2 to start and stop.

# Usage
This application is for afk botting Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege. The main purpose is to farm levels and renown, or to improve reputation (yes, improve).
It currently will get your reputation to 'disruptive' (the second lowest), with no text/voice abuse or friendly fire and a maxed out griefing bar.
Griefing currently has no in-game penalties, unlike the others, so it's useful for clearing out your penalties without actually having to play the game.

Requirements:
- Change these settings (In Settings -> Display):
  - Turn HUD Display Area to 100
  - Turn Menu Display Area to 100
- Download the latest tesseract installer from (https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and do the following:
  - Click INSTALL FOR ONLY ME when asked if you want to installl for anyone on this pc or just you.
  - Make sure to install to the default directory. (Looks something like C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR)

Should work with any 16:9 resolution. Won't work on ultra-wide monitors.

It looks on the screen for in-game buttons, namely buttons to start queue or find another game. It screenshots specific regions of your screen, then covers that screenshot to text, and finally it compares that text to keywords that are different for each region.
It clicks 'ok' on pop-ups, like the common 'connection to server failed' lmao.
It randomly moves the mouse and presses a random amount of the WASD keys, of which, none will repeat to repeatedly not get kicked for inactivity.
It won't send keypresses if "Rainbow Six" isn't the current window, so you can safely alt-tab around with the bot running, and if the game crashes, it won't
do anything with other open applications or the desktop.

You can either run the compiled exe in releases, or you can download the source code, install python and the necessary packages.
Run main.py if you choose to use the source code.

Press F2 to start/stop the bot.
